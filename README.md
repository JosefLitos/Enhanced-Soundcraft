# Enhanced Soundcraft

Minecraft resourcepack replacing multiple sounds with more realistic versions

## Credits

Sounds from:

- [Rainy Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYpUCo8TKQ)
- [Element Animation sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG_Y52bK6Ec)
- [AudioCraft sounds](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/audiocraft)

Enjoy the sounds but be aware of extreme AudioCraft sounds loudness
as I didn't want to lower the sound quality by adjusting all the used sounds.
